# Travel Optimizer

Delve into the transformative power of automation in travel planning and demonstration of technology turning complex itineraries into effortless memorable journeys.

## Motivation

My journey to California in the end of 2023, especially my visit to Yosemite National Park, marked a significant shift in my travel habits, transforming both the landscape around me and my approach to travel planning. The seamless integration of automated itinerary planning turned what could have been a daunting task into an effortless adventure, allowing me to immerse fully in the breathtaking surroundings without the distraction of logistical details. This experience sparked my interest in exploring the impact of digitalization on travel. Through this, I aim to unpack how modern technology not only simplifies the planning process but also enhances the travel experience by harmonizing time management, personal preferences, and real-time adjustments, thus allowing travelers to enjoy the essence of being in a destination.

## How to make use of this code

I've shared a comprehensive guide on how to effectively use my algorithm to cluster destinations that are close not only geographically but also in terms of time efficiency. Given the limited hours available in a day for travel, it's crucial to optimize the use of this time based on the duration needed to visit all the planned locations on your itinerary. I hope my guide enhances your travel planning, helping you save time and streamline your trips!
